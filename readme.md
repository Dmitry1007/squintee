# Notification Demo

A sample demonstrates Notification API usage. The Notification API in Electron
works on OS X, Windows 8 (and up) and sometimes on Linux. [Node-notifier](https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier) is a potential alternative.

Electron's Notification API is implemented with native notification APIs.
On OS X, you can customize your Electron's notification alert style via
`Notifications` panel in `System Preference`.
